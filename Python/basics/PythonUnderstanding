At the Heirarchy
A single .py file is called a module

PackageSytem sometimes also called as libraries
==========
To create a package system - Root Folder with __Init__.py >> Subfolder with __Init__.py and modules in it.

Virtual Enviornments are to be used with projects and built in dependencies
=============
One can create unlimited virtual enviornments and keep switching based on working project to manage dependencies.
set olpt=C:\Darren\TestingData\PythonVirtualEnviornments
set user=dquadros
set pversion=Python312
set penv=testenv312

set user=darre
set plpt=D:\TestingData\PythonEnvs
set pversion=Python312
set penv=testenv312

    Step 1 : Install Python
    -----------
    Download the latest version and install using user account without PATH and Administrative priviligies which is really not required
    use CMD
    C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\%pversion%\python --version
    C:\Users\dquadros\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps - when you install python from the app store
    (Get-Command python).Path - powershell command


    Step 2 : Create your Virtual Env
    ---------------
    Point to any of the versions of Python exe versions on your computer where it is installed.

    Using CMD shell in VS Code navigate to the folder where you want to create all your enviornments :
    1. cd %plpt% -- and run the below command :
    2. C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\%pversion%\python -m venv %plpt%/testenv312 {your enviornment name}

    Note :- In VSCode remember to change the enviornment interpreter path at the bottom right corner, else it will point to the default location and will not list your enviornment packages.

    Create a requirements.txt files with all the required packages for this Project/Package to work
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Step 3 : Activate/Deactivate/Delete your virtual Env.
    --------------------
    %plpt%\%penv%\Scripts\activate.bat
    %plpt%\%penv%\Scripts\deactivate.bat
    using powershell deltet this folder - C:\Darren\Projects\PythonVirtualEnviornments\rm -r dagsterdevenv

    echo %path% - using this env now, the first folder you will see is this env folder.
    python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
